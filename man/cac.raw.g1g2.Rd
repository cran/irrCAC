\title{Dataset of raw ratings from 4 Raters on 14 Subjects that belong to 2 groups named "G1" and "G2"}
\format{This dataset contains ratings obtained from an experiment where 4 raters classified 14 subjects into 5 
possible categories labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. None of the 4 raters scored all 14 units. Therefore, 
some missing ratings appear in each of the columns associated with the 4 raters.

Note that only the the 4 last columns are to be used with the functions included in this package.  The first 2
columns only play a descriptive role and are not used in any calculation.
