\description{
This dataset shows the distribution of 223 psychiatric patients by diagnosis category and by the method used to 
obtain the diagnosis. The first method named ``Clinical Diagnosis" (also known as ``Facility Diagnosis") is used 
in a service facility (e.g. public hospital, or a community unit) and does not rely on a rigorous application of 
research criteria. The second method known as ``Research Diagnosis" is based on a strict application of research 
criteria. Column 1 contains the diagnosis categories into which patients are classified with Method 1.  The first
row on the other hand, shows categories into which patients are classified with Method 2.
