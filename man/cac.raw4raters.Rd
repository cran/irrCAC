\title{Rating Data from 4 Raters and 12 Subjects.}
\format{This dataset contains ratings obtained from an experiment where 4 raters classified 12 subjects into 5 
possible categories labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. None of the 4 raters scored all 12 units. Therefore, 
some missing ratings in the form of "NA" appear in each of the columns associated with the 4 raters.

Note that only the the 4 last columns are to be used with the functions included in this package.  The first 
column only plays a descriptive role and is not used in any calculation.
